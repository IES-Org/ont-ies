v4.3.0 - Changes resulting from project engagements
1. Added Stuff and Count pattern, including addition of:
 Stuff class

 Added example use
2. Added Replaceable Parts pattern, including addition of:
 ReplaceablePart class

3. Changes to Payloads and Groups pattern:

 (Bug fix) Added rdfs:subClassOf relation between ExchangedPayload and rdfs:Resource 4. Changes to Posts and Roles pattern:
 Removal of hasRole, Role and OrganisationRole (breaking change). Instead use ReplaceablePart/InPost example
now provided in the same pattern
 Update to definition of InPost now that is also a InstalledState
 Corrected relationship between inPost and Post from isPartOf to isStateOf 5. Changes to Assessment pattern:
 Addition of Assessment as a new superclass of AssessToBeTrue (non-breaking) 6. Changes to Location pattern:
 regionCountry, addressRegion deleted. Use inLocation instead
 isCentroidOf corrected from being a subProperty of relationship to inLocation

 RadioCoverageArea no longer an Asset as well as a Location 7. Changes to Where and When pattern:
 happensIn, takesplaceIn deleted. Use inLocation instead. 8. Changes to Asset pattern
 storedIn deleted. Use inLocation instead.
9. Changes to Communications Device pattern:
 Removal of installedSoftware, replaced with InstanceOfSoftware which can be associated as being installed using
isPartOf.
 Removed ModelOfDevice and ClassOfDevice. Instantiations of ModelOfDevice to be done instead using
subClassOf Device.
 Linked Device to PartNumber using isIdentifiedBy 10. Changes to Period of Time pattern:
 ParticularPeriod URI pattern now mandated to be non-punctuated encoding (20070118T153000Z). This avoids
the use of escape characters in the URI. NOTE: the literal for iso8601PeriodRepresentation remains punctuated.

13. Changes to Online and Communication patterns covering Message. Message used to inherit from both OnlineEvent and Communication which didn't make sense considering SMS is a subtype of Message. Changes included:
 Deleted subclass relation between Message and OnlineContentEvent
 Added OnlineMessage class with the definition of "A Message that was sent Online."
 Added OnlineMessage to the OnlineEvent diagram
 Made OnlineMessage a subclass of OnlineContentEvent and Message
 Added Communication class to OnlineEvent diagram
 Changed Message definition from "A Communication or OnlineContentEvent where a message is sent" to "A
Communication where a message is sent"
14. IES 4.2 had ClassOfElements and subProperties of rdf:type which encouraged extending the IES classes via ClassOfElements hierarchy rather than the Elements hierarchy. IES 4.3 prunes some of classes (breaking changes) to discourage this behaviour and encourage one approach of extending IES. This approach is documented in "Extending IES4 2024-03-v1.0 O.pdf". Pruned classes and properties include:
 From Authorisation pattern - AuthorisationEventClass deleted – just use subclasses of AuthorisationRequest or
GrantOfAuthority. Also requestedActivity, grantedActivityType and allAuthorisedAgainst deleted
 From Operational pattern - ClassOfOperationalEvent, ClassOfCriminalActivity and typicallyTargets
 From Criminal pattern - Deleted of special forms of rdf:type, typeOfCriminality. Also deleted OffenceCode.
 From Financial Account pattern - Deleted special forms of rdf:type, financialAccountType
ClassOfFinancialAccount
 From Organisation pattern - Deleted ClassOfResponsibleActor
 From Identity Document pattern - Deleted special form of rdf:type, visaType. Also deleted ClassOfTravelVisa.
 From PaymentArtefact pattern - cardType and ClassOfPaymentArtefact. Just extend PaymentArtifact
 From Business pattern - deleted transferType and ClassOfMoneyTransfer. Instead just extend TravelBooking
 From Online pattern - deleted onlineServiceType and ClassOfOnlineService. Instead just extend OnlineService.
Also deleted ClassOfWebResource.
 From Travel Booking - deleted bookingType and ClassOfTravelBooking
 From Communications Account - deleted ClassOfAccount 15. Other changes:
 ExchangedItem changed to Thing. Its definition has also been changed.
 VersionNumber - update to definition to apply to anything that is identifiable
 currencyDenomination no longer a subProperty of relationship and rdf:type. Its now just a subtype of rdf:type
only.
 isParticipantStateIn deleted. Just use isParticipantIn.
 Removed all references of PersonOrOrganisation. All updated to ResponsibleActor
 Marriage no longer a subClassOf LawEnforcement
 Latitude and Longitude specified to be xsd:decimal literals
 hasTheme no longer domain as Investigation, Communication and Meeting. Now that of only Event
 Updated comment for RecurringPeriod. Changed mention of recurringFrom and recurringUntil to startsIn and
endsIn respectively within the definition of RecurringPeriod. Also corrected the mention of
recurrentPeriodRepresentation from recurrentPeriod in the definition of RecurringPeriod.
 Inclusion of missing powertype relations between Elements and ClassOfElements

# Earlier Versions

 GeoRepresentation, ISO19125-WKT and GeoJSON added (see Location page)
 Language is now a class and hasLanguageProficiency links a PersonState to their LanguageProficiency - also

hangover from IES3 and made no sense in 4.
 hasHeight (person) now uses characteristics and measures model - now PersonHeight
 hasTheme (Investigation, Communication, etc.) added to cover those things that are of interest post-event or
thematically - e.g. the thing being investigated is not involved formally

are now subtype of IPAddress

earth

v4.0.0 - FIRST OFFICIAL RELEASE - Changes resulting from initial release and trial implementations
 Rename iso3166-1Alpha-3 to iso3166_1Alpha_3 - hyphens may cause issues with some programming languages (e.g. Python)
 Rename UN-LOCODE to UN_LOCODE - hyphens may cause issues with some programming languages (e.g. Python)

unidentified people)
 Duration added - this was an oversight. It had been discussed and was supposed to have been added, but
slipped through the net.
 Reversed the direction of all the representation relationships (names, IDs, etc.) as the existing direction was
counter-intuitive in RDF TTL and JSON-LD
 vehicleIdentificationNumber had not been changed to an Identifier before initial release. This was an oversight.
Now corrected.
 bookingReference had not been changed to an Identifier before initial release. This was an oversight. Now
corrected.
 Added knownAssociate to the Social diagram
 isTeacherOf added to Professional diagram
 worksWith reinstated (was taken out in v4, but there are cases where it can't be replaced by organisation and
employedBy)
