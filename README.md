## Overview  

The **Information Exchange Standard (IES)** is a UK Government initiative to support consistent, open, and interoperable data exchange. It provides a shared semantic foundation that enables public sector organisations to collaborate and integrate systems more effectively.  

The standard is designed to be modular and extensible, with support for evolving domain-specific extensions led by diverse teams across government.  

This repository is the official home of IES and includes documentation, example data, and ontology models to support adoption and use.

## Governance and Custodianship  

While the Information Exchange Standard is not a legal entity, it represents a collaborative effort across multiple UK government bodies, including (but not limited to):

- Department for Business and Trade (DBT) *(custodian of this repository)*  
- Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl)  
- Ministry of Defence (MOD)  
- Metropolitan Police  
- Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO)  
- Home Office (HO)  
- HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)  

These organisations act as the custodians and decision-makers for the ongoing development of the Standard.  

The development of this work is supported by private sector suppliers and technical specialists engaged through formal agreements. Their contributions are formally recognised in the [`ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md`](./ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md) file.

## Project History  

This repository replaces the earlier [`IES4`](https://github.com/dstl/IES4) repository, originally hosted by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), which was archived on 4 March 2025.  

Following that archive, the work was migrated here, adapted, and extended to support ongoing collaboration, development, and publication of new domain-specific extensions. This repository is now the authoritative and actively maintained home of the Information Exchange Standard.
