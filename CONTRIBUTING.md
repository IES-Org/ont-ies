**Description:** `Guidelines for issue reporting, documentation suggestions, and the IES controlled contribution model.`  
<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: OGL-UK-3.0 -->  

Thank you for your interest in this repository.  
The Information Exchange Standard (IES) is developed and maintained as a cross-government initiative with contributions from various UK government organisations and technical support from approved suppliers and subject matter specialists.

The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) is the current custodian of this repository and the GitHub organisation, acting on behalf of a broader group of stakeholders.  

IES follows an **open-source governance model**, where all code is **publicly available** under open-source licences, and collaboration is invited from **approved contributors**. While direct code contributions from the general public are not currently accepted, we **welcome feedback, issue reporting, and documentation suggestions**.  

To see a list of contributing organisations and individuals, refer to [ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md](ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md) and the GitHub contributor insights page at [Contributors](https://github.com/IES-Org/ies/graphs/contributors).

## How You Can Contribute  

Public users and contributors are encouraged to engage in the following ways:  
- **Reporting bugs and issues** – If you find a problem, please open a GitHub issue.  
- **Suggesting documentation improvements** – Propose clarifications or additions to existing documentation.  
- **Providing structured feedback** – Use GitHub Issues to share ideas and enhancement suggestions.  

All input is welcome and will be reviewed by maintainers, but prioritisation is subject to IES goals and delivery timelines.

At this time, IES does not accept **public pull requests (PRs)** or **direct code contributions**. Contributions are limited to **approved government contributors and suppliers** working under formal arrangements.

## Reporting Issues  
If you encounter a bug, error, or inconsistency, please follow these steps:  
1. Check for an existing issue under [Issues](https://github.com/IES-Org/ies/issues).  
2. Open a new issue if none exists. Use one of the available templates.  
3. Provide a clear and detailed description, including steps to reproduce if applicable.  
4. Use labels (bug, documentation, enhancement, etc.) where appropriate.  

For security-related concerns, do not submit a public issue. Follow our [Responsible Disclosure process](SECURITY.md).

## Documentation Feedback  

If you find an error, need clarification, or have suggestions for improving documentation:  

1. Open a GitHub issue using the `documentation` label.  
2. Describe the suggestion clearly, referencing specific content where possible.  
3. Structured, specific feedback helps us respond more effectively.  

Documentation updates are prioritised based on user impact and strategic relevance.

## IES Approach to Open-Source Development  
- **All code is published under open-source licences.**  
- **Development is led by contributors from government and approved suppliers.**  
- **Feedback is welcome and helps shape ongoing development.**

## Branching Strategy  

This repository contains released versions of IES only and development is managed in the IES development repository. Therefore, only the `main` branch is maintained in this repository and tags used to denote IES versions using the semantic versioning format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
